Elisa C. Baek, Ph.D. is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her primary affiliation is with the <a href="http://csnlab.org/" target="_blank">Computational Social Neuroscience Lab</a>. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 2019. She uses neuroimaging and network analysis to study various facets of social connection, such as what helps people feel connected to others, what distinguishes people who are great at connecting with others, and the factors that contribute to social disconnection. Some of her prior and ongoing work investigates the neural and psychological drivers of information sharing, the associations between subjective and objective social (dis)connection and neural responses, and the neural correlates of social influence. She is also interested in persuasion and message effects, particularly in the health domain, such as what makes messages more persuasive and effective.

Her fellowship is currently supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1835239 and SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship under Grant No. 1911783. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

Research Areas
======
* Information sharing and its role in promoting social connection
  * What are the drivers of sharing decisions? 
  * What motivates us to share information with others? 
  * How does sharing information with others foster social connection?

* Neural correlates of subjective and objective social (dis)connection
  * Are individuals who are well-connected in a social network distinguished in the way that they process the world around them?
  * How do individuals who experience subjective disconnection (e.g., loneliness) see the world around them, compared to others in their social circles?
  * Are well-connected or less well-connected individuals at greater risk for social influence, or greater sensitiity to negative social experiences?

* Social influence and persuasion
  * What distinguishes a successful communicator/persuader?
  * What are the social network and neural features that distinguish influential individuals?
